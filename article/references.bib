abstract = {The progressive transmission of map data over World Wide Web provides the user with a self-adaptive strategy to access remote data. The key technology in this transmission is the efficient multi-scale representation of spatial data and pre-organization on server at a scale associated order. This study aims at the progressive transmission of hydrographic data investigating some constraints of multi-scale representation and offering an hierarchical data model of river network at both object and geometric detail levels. Through watershed partitioning generates the channel order in significance increment and then by BLG tree structure divides and stores the different representation of individual river. For a given scale, the data model can derive which river segments to be transmitted and in what detail level to be represented. The experiment shows the application of this data model in progressive transmission is successful.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an inexpensive approach to create highly detailed reconstructions of the landscape surrounding a road. Our method is based on a space-efficient semi-procedural representation of the terrain and vegetation supporting high-quality real-time rendering not only for aerial views but also at road level. We can integrate photographs along selected road stretches. We merge the point clouds extracted from these photographs with a low-resolution digital terrain model through a novel algorithm which is robust against noise and missing data. We pre-compute plausible locations for trees through an algorithm which takes into account perceptual cues. At runtime we render the reconstructed terrain along with plants generated procedurally according to pre-computed parameters. Our rendering algorithm ensures visual consistency with aerial imagery and thus it can be integrated seamlessly with current virtual globes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

These features can be interactively edited, and the landscape can be explored in real time at any altitude from flight view to car view. We use vector descriptions of linear and areal features, with associated shaders to specify their appearance (terrain color and material), their footprint (effect on terrain shape), and their associated objects (bridges, hedges, etc.). In order to encompass both very large terrains and very fine details we rely on a view dependent quadtree refinement scheme. New quads are generated when needed and cached on the GPU. For each quad we produce on the GPU an appearance texture, a footprint texture, and some object meshes, based on the features vector description and their associated shaders. Adaptive refinement, procedural vector features and a mipmap pyramid provide three LOD mechanisms for small, medium and large scale quads. Our results and attached video show high performance with high visual quality.},

abstract = {Realistic real-time rendering and lighting of forests is an important aspect for simulators and video games. This is a difficult problem, due to the massive amount of geometry: aerial forest views display millions of trees on a wide range of distances, from the camera to the horizon. Light interactions, whose effects are visible at all scales, are also a problem: sun and sky dome contributions, shadows between trees, inside trees, on the ground, and view-light masking correlations. In this paper we present a method to render very large forest scenes in realtime, with realistic lighting at all scales, and without popping nor aliasing. Our method is based on two new forest representations, z-fields and shader-maps, with a seamless transition between them. Our first model builds on light fields and height fields to represent and render the nearest trees individually, accounting for all lighting effects. Our second model is a location, view and light dependent shader mapped on the terrain, accounting for the cumulated subpixel effects. Qualitative comparisons with photos show that our method produces realistic results.},

abstract = {Many digital elevation models (DEMs) have difficulty replicating hydrological patterns in flat landscapes. Efforts to improve DEM performance in replicating known hydrology have included a variety of soft (i.e. algorithm-based approaches) and hard techniques, such as "Stream burning" or "surface reconditioning" (e.g. Agree or ANUDEM). Using a representation of the known stream network, these methods trench or mathematically warp the original DEM to improve how accurately stream position, stream length and catchment boundaries replicate known hydrological conditions. However, these techniques permanently alter the DEM and may affect further analyses (e.g. slope). This paper explores the impact that commonly used hydrological correction methods (Stream burning, Agree.aml and ANUDEM v4.6.3 and ANUDEM v5.1) have on the overall nature of a DEM, finding that different methods produce non-convergent outcomes for catchment parameters (such as catchment boundaries, stream position and length), and differentially compromise secondary terrain analysis. All hydrological correction methods successfully improved calculation of catchment area, stream position and length as compared to using the DEM without any modification, but they all increased catchment slope. No single method performing best across all categories. Different hydrological correction methods changed elevation and slope in different spatial patterns and magnitudes, compromising the ability to derive catchment parameters and conduct secondary terrain analysis from a single DEM. Modification of a DEM to better reflect known hydrology can be useful, however knowledge of the magnitude and spatial pattern of the changes are required before using a DEM for subsequent analyses. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The generation of these networks according to the requirements, if done manually by road design specialists, results in a time consuming task. Procedural generation of road networks comes as a solution to this problem with the creation of complete road networks definition adequate to simulation. This paper proposes a method to automatically generate an optimized definition of very large roads network, in an integrated process, from the selection of nodes in a terrain area, to the network topological definition. The human supervisor can interact with this generation process at any stage, in order to obtain custom road networks definitions. The proposed method reduces the use of specialists for preparing large road networks definitions. These definitions are suitable to integrate into a broader process to create road environments, with different road types, appropriate to conducting scientific experiments in driving simulation.},

abstract = {We present a simple stochastic system for non-periodically tiling the plane with a small set of Wang Tiles. The tiles may be filled with texture, patterns, or geometry that when assembled create a contin-uous representation. The primary advantage of using Wang Tiles is that once the tiles are filled, large expanses of non-periodic texture (or patterns or geometry) can be created as needed very efficiently at runtime. Wang Tiles are squares in which each edge is assigned a color. A valid tiling requires all shared edges between tiles to have matching colors. We present a new stochastic algorithm to non-periodically tile the plane with a small set of Wang Tiles at runtime. Furthermore, we present new methods to fill the tiles with 2D tex-ture, 2D Poisson distributions, or 3D geometry to efficiently create at runtime as much non-periodic texture (or distributions, or geom-etry) as needed. We leverage previous texture synthesis work and adapt it to fill Wang Tiles. We demonstrate how to fill individual tiles with Poisson distributions that maintain their statistical proper-ties when combined. These are used to generate a large arrangement of plants or other objects on a terrain. We show how such envi-ronments can be rendered efficiently by pre-lighting the individual Wang Tiles containing the geometry. We also extend the definition of Wang Tiles to include a coding of the tile corners to allow discrete objects to overlap more than one edge. The larger set of tiles provides increased degrees of freedom.},

This map reveals that the global number of trees is approximately 3.04 trillion, an order of magnitude higher than the previous estimate. Of these trees, approximately 1.39 trillion exist in tropical and subtropical forests, with 0.74 trillion in boreal regions and 0.61 trillion in temperate regions. Biome-level trends in tree density demonstrate the importance of climate and topography in controlling local tree densities at finer scales, as well as the overwhelming effect of humans across most of the world. Based on our projected tree densities, we estimate that over 15 billion trees are cut down each year, and the global number of trees has fallen by approximately 46{\%} since the start of human civilization.},

Therefore, methods that allow combine visualization of terrain and geospatial vecor data are required. Such methods have to adapt the vector data to the terrain surface and to ensure a precise and efficient mapping. In this paper, a rendering method based on the stencil shadow volumes theory is presented, which allows high-waulity real-time overlay of vector data on virtual landscapes. The method includes three steps which are the generation of the vector data polyhedra, creation of the mask in stencil buffer and the application of the mask to the scene to redner the vector data. The research and expriment show that our approach is a screen-space algorithm and is of pixel-level precision. Since it does not suffer from aliasing artifacts like texture-based techniques and independent of the complexity of the terrain data set, it can achieve good performance for the rendering of 3D vector data.},

abstract = {We study the complexity and the i/o-efficient computation of flow on triangulated terrains. We present an acyclic graph, the descent graph, that enables us to trace flow paths in triangulations i/o-efficiently. We use the descent graph to obtain i/o-efficient algorithms for computing river networks and watershed-area maps in O(Sort(d+r)) i/o's, where r is the complexity of the river network and d of the descent graph. Furthermore we describe a data structure based on the subdivision of the terrain induced by the edges of the triangulation and paths of steepest ascent and descent from its vertices. This data structure can be used to report the boundary of the watershed of a query point q or the flow path from q in O(l(s)+Scan(k)) i/o's, where s is the complexity of the subdivision underlying the data structure, l(s) is the number of i/o's used for planar point location in this subdivision, and k is the size of the reported output. On $\alpha$-fat terrains, that is, triangulated terrains where the minimum angle of any triangle is bounded from below by $\alpha$, we show that the worst-case complexity of the descent graph and of any path of steepest descent is O(n/$\alpha$2), where n is the number of triangles in the terrain. The worst-case complexity of the river network and the above-mentioned data structure on such terrains is O(n2/$\alpha$2). When $\alpha$ is a positive constant this improves the corresponding bounds for arbitrary terrains by a linear factor. We prove that similar bounds cannot be proven for Delaunay triangulations: these can have river networks of complexity $\Theta$(n3).},

abstract = {Realistic terrain models are required in many applications, especially in computer games. Commonly, procedu- ral models are applied to generate the corresponding models and let users experience a wide variety of new environments. Existing algorithms generate landscapes immediately with view-dependent resolution and without preprocessing. Unfortunately, landscapes generated by such algorithms lack river networks and therefore appear unnatural. Algorithms that integrate realistic river networks are computationally expensive and cannot be used to generate a locally adaptive high resolution landscape during a fly-through. In this paper, we propose a novel al- gorithm to generate realistic river networks. Our procedural algorithm creates complete planets and landscapes with realistic river networks within seconds.

abstract = {The Brazilian Cerrado biome comprises a vertically structured mosaic of grassland, shrubland, and woodland physiognomies with distinct phenology patterns. In this study, we investigated the utility of spectral vegetation indices in differentiating these physiognomies and in monitoring their seasonal dynamics. We obtained high spectral resolution reflectances, during the 2000 wet and dry seasons, over the major Cerrado types at Brasilia National Park (BNP) using the light aircraft-based Modland Quick Airborne Looks (MQUALS) package, consisting of a spectroradiometer and digital camera. Site-intensive biophysical and canopy structural measurements were made simultaneously at each of the Cerrado types including Cerrado grassland, shrub Cerrado, wooded Cerrado, Cerrado woodland, and gallery forest. We analyzed the spectral reflectance signatures, their first derivative analogs, and convolved spectral vegetation indices (VI) over all the Cerrado physiognomies. The high spectral resolution data were convolved to the MODIS, AVHRR, and ETM
                        + bandpasses and converted to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to simulate their respective sensors. Dry and wet season comparisons of the measured biophysical attributes were made with the reflectance and VI data for the different Cerrado physiognomies. We found that three major domains of Cerrado could be distinguished with the dry and wet season spectral signatures and vegetation indices. The EVI showed a higher sensitivity to seasonality than the NDVI; however, both indices displayed seasonal variations that were approximately one-half that found with the measured landscape green cover dynamics. Inter-sensor comparisons of seasonal dynamics, based on spectral bandpass properties, revealed the ETM 
                        +-simulated VIs had the best seasonal discrimination capability, followed by MODIS and AVHRR. Differences between sensor bandpass-derived VI values, however, varied with Cerrado type and between dry and wet seasons, indicating the need for inter-sensor VI translation equations for effective multi-sensor applications. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, situated within the scope of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia project (LBA), we conducted a wet season ground and airborne campaign over the Brasilia National Park (BNP), the largest LBA core site in the Cerrado biome, to measure the optical and biophysical properties of the major Cerrado land cover types. We investigated land cover discrimination through the analyses of fine resolution spectra, convolved spectra (MODIS bandpasses), and vegetation indices - the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI). At these three data levels, three major physiognomic domains (herbaceous, woody, and forested) could be readily identified, and the amount of data correctly classified into the five major land cover types found at BNP were 91{\%} (full spectra), 78{\%} (red and NIR), 75{\%} (NDVI), and 71{\%} (EVI). A synergism between the NDVI and EVI was also evident, and together, these two indices were capable of correctly classifying 82{\%} of the total data set.

abstract = {The calculation of slope (downhill gradient) for a point in a digital elevation model (DEM) is a common procedure in the hydrological, environmental and remote sensing sciences. The most commonly used slope calculation algorithms employed on DEM topography data make use of a three-by-three search window or kernel centered on the grid point (grid cell) in question in order to calculate the slope at that point. A comparison of eight such slope calculation algorithms has been carried out using an artificial DEM, consisting of a smooth synthetic test surface with various amounts of added Gaussian noise. Morrison's Surface III, a trigonometrically defined surface, was used as the synthetic test surface. Residual slope grids were calculated by subtracting the slope grids produced by the algorithms on test from true/reference slope grids derived by analytic partial differentiation of the synthetic surface. The resulting residual slope grids were used to calculate root-mean-square (RMS) residual error estimates that were used to rank the slope algorithms from “best” (lowest value of RMS residual error) to “worst” (largest value of RMS residual error). Fleming and Hoffer's method gave the “best” results for slope estimation when values of added Gaussian noise were very small compared to the mean smooth elevation difference (MSED) measured within three-by-three elevation point windows on the synthetic surface. Horn's method (used in ArcInfo GRID) performed better than Fleming and Hoffer's as a slope estimator when the noise amplitude was very much larger than the MSED. For the large noise amplitude situation the “best” overall performing method was that of Sharpnack and Akin. The popular Maximum Downward Gradient Method (MDG) performed poorly coming close to last in the rankings, for both situations, as did the Simple Method. A nonogram was produced in terms of standard deviation of the Gaussian noise and MSED values that gave the locus of the trade-off point between Fleming and Hoffer's and Horn's methods.},

abstract = {During recent years, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a powerful tool have had a tremendous impact on research techniques in the realm of geography and spatial analysis. The integrative ability of GIS to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and finally present all types of geographical spatial data, has drawn many attentions to it. Water Resources Engineering as a interdisciplinary field requires modeling and analyzing data with different spatial resolutions. Therefore, GIS could definitely be utilized as a suitable tool for solving water resources problems from local to global scale. This paper tries to present the larger scheme of the benefits for the applications of GIS in water resources and hydrological modeling in particular. Certainly, within the few pages ahead only the surface is scratched and a more thorough and comprehensive review requires more time and effort. The fundamental reason for the need of integrating GIS and hydrological modeling is briefly discussed and different tools are introduced. Also, various examples of GIS application are presented to create a better understanding. Case studies such as the Wadi Madoneh Basin in Jordan, Kuronagi River in Japan and San Antonio River Basin in Central Texas, USA, are presented. The good agreement between the results from a fairly simple GIS model and observations in cases such as Kuronagi River and Wadi Madoneh is indicating a promising future for GIS application in hydrological modeling. Finally, the benefits of GIS utilization in the field are discussed and summarized.},

For example, in twolevel models, plant distributions may be determined using coarse plant representations, and realistic visualizations may be obtained by substituting detailed plant models for the coarse ones. In this paper, we focus on the coarse aspect of modeling, the specification of plant distribution. We consider two classes of models: localtoglobal models, rooted in the individualbased ecosystem simulations, and inverse, globaltolocal models, in which positions of individual plants are inferred from a given distribution of plant densities. We extend previous results obtained using both classes of models with additional phenomena, including clustering and succession of plants. We also introduce the formalism of multiset Lsystems to formalize the individualbased simulation models.},

abstract = {Most landscapes are covered by some type of vegetation, therefore digital modelling of vegetation is a prerequisite for three-dimensional landscape visualisation. Vegetation can be modelled either at the level of individual plants or as a terrain texture. At object scale, plants can be described by a set of rules which define the shape of its individual parts (stems, leafs, flowers, etc.) as well as their configuration and temporal development. Some applications available for planners are based on botanical models, such as L-grammar [Development models of multicellular organisms: a computer graphics perspective. In: Langton, E.C. (Ed.), Artificial Life. Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1988, p. 221] or the AMAP system [J. Biosci. 17 (3) (1992) 275]. The use of this approach often yields very large files and requires powerful computing equipment. Other applications aim at an optimisation of the rendering speed by using simplified, more symbolic objects. At landscape scale, vegetation is often described as a texture of the terrain. This can be done by simple image mapping or by three-dimensional texture mapping techniques, such as bump mapping, displacement mapping or particle emission mapping. The most difficult scale level is the one between object and landscape scale, where both approaches have to be combined in order to optimise the visual quality as well as the processing speed. In the market, an increasing number of plant visualisation systems is now available. Selection criteria from the point of view of planning practice should not only include aspects of rendering quality, but also aspects of integration with standard applications at object and landscape scale, such as CAD, GIS, DBMS, and terrain modelling. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The spatial heterogeneity of the forest shown by the variation of this scaling exponent determined for each hectare in the area of study. The box counting method was used to determine the fractal dimensions (d(f)) of the spatial patterns of the trees. The spatial pattern for all the trees taken as a whole had a d(f) of 1.81. The fractal dimensions for the patterns of the six most abundant species ranged from 1.73 to 1.75. On the other hand, values of df as measured from each hectare were less than 1.5, suggesting that the pattern is not self-similar over a significant range of length scales.},

@article{Riginos2008,
abstract = {Herbivores choose their habitats both to maximize forage intake and to minimize their risk of predation. For African savanna herbivores, the available habitats range in woody cover from open areas with few trees to dense, almost-closed woodlands. This variation in woody cover or density can have a number of consequences for herbaceous species composition, cover, and productivity, as well as for ease of predator detection and avoidance. Here, we consider two alternative possibilities: first, that tree density affects the herbaceous vegetation, with concomitant ?bottom-up? effects on herbivore habitat preferences; or, second, that tree density affects predator visibility, mediating ?top-down? effects of predators on herbivore habitat preferences. We sampled sites spanning a 10-fold range of tree densities in an Acacia drepanolobium-dominated savanna in Laikipia, Kenya, for variation in (1) herbaceous cover, composition, and species richness; (2) wild and domestic herbivore use; and (3) degree of visibility obstruction by the tree layer. We then used structural equation modeling to consider the potential influences that tree density may have on herbivores and herbaceous community properties. Tree density was associated with substantial variation in herbaceous species composition and richness. Cattle exhibited a fairly uniform use of the landscape, whereas wild herbivores, with the exception of elephants, exhibited a strong preference for areas of low tree density. Model results suggest that this was not a response to variation in herbaceous-community characteristics, but rather a response to the greater visibility associated with more open places. Elephants, in contrast, preferred areas with higher densities of trees, apparently because of greater forage availability. These results suggest that, for all but the largest species, top-down behavioral effects of predator avoidance on herbivores are mediated by tree density. This, in turn, appears to have cascading effects on the herbaceous vegetation. These results shed light on one of the major features of the ?landscape of fear? in which African savanna herbivores exist.},

The gol is to store these maps without the loss of information that results from digitization, and to obtain a worst-case execution time that is not overly sensitive to the positioning of the map. A regular decomposition variant of the region quadtree is used to organize the vertices and edges of the maps. A number of related data organizations are proposed in an iterative manner until a method is obtained that meets the stated goals. The result is termed a PM (polygonal map) quadtree and is based on a regular decomposition point space quadtree (PR quadtree) that stores additional information about the edges at its terminal nodes. Algorithms are given for inserting and deleting line segments from a PM quadtree. Use of the PM quadtree to perform point location, dynamic line insertion, and map overlay is discussed. The PM quadtree is compared conceptually to the K-structure and the layered dag with respect to typical cartographic data. An empirical comparison of the PM quadtree with other quadtree-based representations for polygonal maps is also provided.},

Since high-resolution DEMs are increasingly used in geomorphological and hydrological research, automated and semi-automated procedures to reduce the impact of such errors on flow networks are required. One such technique is stream-carving, a hydrological conditioning technique to ensure drainage connectivity in DEMs towards the DEM edges. Here we test and modify a state-of-the-art carving algorithm for flow network derivation in a low-relief, agricultural landscape characterized by a large number of spurious, topographic depressions. Our results show that the investigated algorithm reconstructs a benchmark network insufficiently in terms of carving energy, distance and a topological network measure. The modification to the algorithm that performed best, combines the least-cost auxiliary topography (LCAT) carving with a constrained breaching algorithm that explicitly takes automatically identified channel locations into account. We applied our methods to a low relief landscape, but the results can be transferred to flow network derivation of DEMs in moderate to mountainous relief in situations where the valley bottom is broad and flat and precise derivations of the flow networks are needed.

abstract = {With the ever increasing costs of manual content creation for virtual worlds, the potential of creating it automatically becomes too attractive to ignore. However, for most designers, traditional procedural content generation methods are complex and unintuitive to use, hard to control, and generated results are not easily integrated into a complete and consistent virtual world. We introduce a novel declarative modeling approach that enables designers to concentrate on stating what they want to create instead of on describing how they should model it. It aims at reducing the complexity of virtual world modeling by combining the strengths of semantics-based modeling with manual and procedural approaches. This article describes two of its main contributions to procedural modeling of virtual worlds: interactive procedural sketching and virtual world consistency maintenance. We discuss how these techniques, integrated in our modeling framework SketchaWorld, build up to enable designers to create a complete 3D virtual world in minutes. Procedural sketching provides a fast and more intuitive way to model virtual worlds, by letting designers interactively sketch their virtual world using high-level terrain features, which are then procedurally expanded using a variety of integrated procedural methods. Consistency maintenance guarantees that the semantics of all terrain features is preserved throughout the modeling process. In particular, it automatically solves conflicts possibly emerging from interactions between terrain features. We believe that these contributions together represent a significant step towards providing more user control and flexibility in procedural modeling of virtual worlds. It can therefore be expected that by further reducing its complexity, virtual world modeling will become accessible to an increasingly broad group of users. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We survey procedural methods that are useful to generate features of virtual worlds, including terrains, vegetation, rivers, roads, buildings and entire cities. In this survey, we focus particularly on the degree of intuitive control and of interactivity offered by each procedural method, because these properties are instrumental for their typical users: designers and artists. We identify the most promising research results that have been recently achieved, but we also realize that there is far from widespread acceptance of procedural methods among non-technical, creative professionals.

@article{Sofia2014,
abstract = {In floodplains, anthropogenic features such as levees or road scarps, control and influence flows. An up-to-date and accurate digital data about these features are deeply needed for irrigation and flood mitigation purposes. Nowadays, LiDAR Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) covering large areas are available for public authorities, and there is a widespread interest in the application of such models for the automatic or semiautomatic recognition of features. The automatic recognition of levees and road scarps from these models can offer a quick and accurate method to improve topographic databases for large-scale applications. In mountainous contexts, geomorphometric indicators derived from DTMs have been proven to be reliable for feasible applications, and the use of statistical operators as thresholds showed a high reliability to identify features. The goal of this research is to test if similar approaches can be feasible also in floodplains. Three different parameters are tested at different scales on LiDAR DTM. The boxplot is applied to identify an objective threshold for feature extraction, and a filtering procedure is proposed to improve the quality of the extractions. This analysis, in line with other works for different environments, underlined (1) how statistical parameters can offer an objective threshold to identify features with varying shapes, size and height; (2) that the effectiveness of topographic parameters to identify anthropogenic features is related to the dimension of the investigated areas. The analysis also showed that the shape of the investigated area has not much influence on the quality of the results. While the effectiveness of residual topography had already been proven, the proposed study underlined how the use of entropy can anyway provide good extractions, with an overall quality comparable to the one offered by residual topography, and with the only limitation that the extracted features are slightly wider than the investigated one.},

WaterWorld is a user-directed automatic terrain generation tool that we have designed. Similar to existing methods, it allows users to create mountains, canyons, rivers and seas.

@article{Turcotte2001,
abstract = {Distributed hydrological models require a detailed definition of a watershed's internal drainage structure. The conventional approach to obtain this drainage structure is to use an eight flow direction matrix (D8) which is derived from a raster digital elevation model (DEM). However, this approach leads to a rather coarse drainage structure when monitoring or gauging stations need to be accurately located within a watershed. This is largely due to limitations of the D8 approach and the lack of information over flat areas and pits. The D8 approach alone is also unable to differentiate lakes from plain areas. To avoid these problems a new approach, using a digital river and lake network (DRLN) as input in addition to the DEM, has been developed. This new approach allows for an accurate fit between the DRLN and the modelled drainage structure, which is represented by a flow direction matrix and a modelled watercourse network. More importantly, the identification of lakes within the modelled network is now possible. The proposed approach, which is largely rooted in the D8 approach, uses the DRLN to correct modelled flow directions and network calculations. For DEM cells overlapped by the DRLN, flow directions are determined using DRLN connections only. The flow directions of the other DEM cells are evaluated with the D8 approach which uses a DEM that has been modified as a function of distance to the DRLN. The proposed approach has been tested on the Chaudie `re River watershed in southern Que ´bec, Canada. The modelled watershed drainage structure showed a high level of coherence with the DRLN. A comparison between the results obtained with the D8 approach and those obtained by the proposed approach clearly demonstrated an improvement over the conven- tionally modelled drainage structure. The proposed approach will benefit hydrological models which require data such as a flow direction matrix, a river and lake network and sub-watersheds for drainage structure information.},

abstract = {Planners have a long history of using Geographic Information Systems, simulation models and three-dimensional (3D) visualizations in research and practice projects. Although some have successfully integrated GIS and simulation modeling or GIS and computer visualization, few have met the challenge of integrating the three technologies into one system in order to support planning and decision-making. In an effort toward reaching this goal, a prototype traffic impact analysis system has been developed. Automobile traffic and travel speed are predicted with a volume/capacity ratio model. Carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations along roadways are calculated using the US Environmental Protection Agency's CAL3QHC model. GIS is used to prepare data and execute the models and present the modeling results in a geographic context. A series of 3D models of street segments and buildings along the highway are developed and subsequently integrated with simulation results to allow a geo-referenced 3D presentation, including animations of driving experiences. This study documents the benefits and challenges of integrating the technologies. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this form, the data are insufficient for applications such as simulation and 3D visualization-tools which will grow in power and demand as sensor data become more pervasive and as governments try to optimize their existing physical infrastructure. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for enhancing a road map from a GIS database to create a geometrically and topologically consistent 3D model to be used in real-time traffic simulation, interactive visualization of virtual worlds, and autonomous vehicle navigation. The resulting representation provides important road features for traffic simulations, including ramps, highways, overpasses, legal merge zones, and intersections with arbitrary states, and it is independent of the simulation methodologies. We test the 3D models of road networks generated by our algorithm on real-time traffic simulation using both macroscopic and microscopic techniques.},

abstract = {The surface runoff process in fluvial/pluvial flood modelling is often simulated employing a two-dimensional (2-D) diffusive wave approximation described by grid based digital elevation models (DEMs). However, this approach may cause potential problems when using the 2-D surface flow model which exchanges flows through adjacent cells, with conventional sink removal algorithms which also allow for flow exchange along diagonal directions, due to the exis- tence of artificial depression in DEMs. In this paper, we pro- pose an effective method for filling artificial depressions in DEM so that the problem can be addressed. We firstly anal- yse two types of depressions in DEMs and demonstrate the issues caused by the current depression filling algorithms us- ing the surface flow simulations from the MIKE SHE model built for a medium-sized basin in Southeast England. The proposed depression-filling algorithm for 2-D overland flow modelling is applied and evaluated by comparing the sim- ulated flows at the outlet of the catchment represented by DEMs at various resolutions (50 m, 100m and 200 m). The results suggest that the existence of depressions in DEMs can substantially influence the overland flow estimation and the new depression filling algorithm is shown to be effective in tackling this issue based upon the comparison of simulations for sink-dominated and sink-free DEMs, especially in the ar- eas with relatively flat topography.},
